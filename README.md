# SysChecks

## Introduction

`syschecks` v2 is written in Go, and is a natural successor of my previous project which was written in Python.

This latest version executes a bit faster and doesn't require `zabbix` user to have `sudo` privileges to run it.

## Installation

All you need to do to install it, is execute the command below:

```shell
curl -S https://github.com/yaroslav/syschecks/-/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

> The installation script can be used to update the software too.
